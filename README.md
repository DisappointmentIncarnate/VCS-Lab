  - If you would like to contribute, add make your changes in a fork in GitHub and push them through Jupyterhub. If they are deemed valuable, they will be accepted.
MISC:
- We have included our current license rather than other versions because in order to find it, we used the fewest amount of clicks and search bar entries to find it. It was at the top of the list, and we put our faith in Google to show us the most reliable results before the less reliable sources. 
- The current code of conduct includes exactly what we think creates a safe and health environment for any and all users.
